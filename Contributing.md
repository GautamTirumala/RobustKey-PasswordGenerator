### Coding Standards for `RobustKey-PasswordGenerator`

These coding standards are designed to maintain a consistent and readable codebase in our React.js project. Adhering to these guidelines will make it easier for team members to collaborate effectively. Please follow these standards when contributing to the project.

### File and Folder Structure

- Organize project files and components logically within the following folder structure:
    ```
    /src
        /components
        /assets
    ```

- Use meaningful and descriptive folder and file names.

### Component Naming

- Use PascalCase (UpperCamelCase) for component names, e.g., `MyComponent`, `Header`, `TodoList`.
- Avoid generic or ambiguous component names, eg., `mycomponent`, `card`.

### Functional Components

- Prefer functional components over class components.
- Use React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) for managing component state and side effects.

### Component Structure

- Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid long functions within components.
- Use destructuring for props and state to simplify code.

### Imports and Dependencies

- Organize import statements clearly and group related imports.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies and remove unused imports.

### Examples

### Folder and File Structure
```plaintext
/src
    /components
            Header.jsx
            TodoList.jsx
    /assets
